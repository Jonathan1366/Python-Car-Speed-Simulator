# Python-Car-Speed-Simulator
This repository contains Python code for a simple car speed simulator. The simulator can simulate the speed of a regular car and a sports car. It includes features such as increasing speed and a special ‘nos’ feature for the sports car that significantly increases its speed. This project is a great example of object-oriented programming in Python, demonstrating the use of classes, inheritance, and methods.
